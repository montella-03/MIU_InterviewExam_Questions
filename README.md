## Data Structures

This repository includes implementations of the following data structures in Java:

1. **Arrays**: Implementation of dynamic arrays and common array operations.
2. **Linked Lists**: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists.
3. **Stacks**: Implementation of a stack data structure.
4. **Queues**: Implementation of queue data structures including FIFO and priority queues.
5. **Trees**: Implementations of binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and AVL trees.
6. **Graphs**: Implementations of various graph data structures and algorithms, such as adjacency list and adjacency matrix.
7. **Hash Tables**: Implementation of a hash table with collision handling techniques.
8. **Heaps**: Implementation of min-heap and max-heap data structures.
9. **Trie**: Implementation of a trie data structure for efficient string searches.
10. **Graph Algorithms**: Various graph algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).

Each data structure is organized in its own directory with detailed comments and explanations in the code files.

## Usage

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/montella-03/MIU_InterviewExam_Questions.git

   

Navigate to the specific data structure directory you are interested in, e.g., array, linked_list, etc.

Inside each directory, you will find Java files containing the implementations. Open these files to view the code and comments explaining the data structure and its operations.

You can use the code by importing the respective Java classes into your own projects.

To compile and run the code, use standard Java development tools such as javac and java.

To run unit tests (if available), use testing frameworks like JUnit.
